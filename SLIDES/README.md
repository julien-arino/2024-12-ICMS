These are the files required to compile the slides. Although a LaTeX version is provided, it is best to knit the Rnw files. 

- The FIGS directory contains figures required for compiling the slides as well as figures generated by `R` when the Rnw files are knit.
- The FIGS-slides-admin directory contains figures used for transition between sections, logos and the like.
- The slides-setup-*.tex files are style and definition files used when compiling the beamer presentations.
- compile-and-push is a batch script that compiles the files and pushes the results to this github repo. Of course, it will be useless to you, but illustrates running the code from the command line.
